A Wordpress plugin which swaps out the textarea used for excerpts with a TinyMCE editor instance.

== Description ==

The Plugin uses the [wp_editor](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_editor) function to generate a rich text editor for page/post excerpts, so **will only work in Wordpress 3.3 or greater**.

The plugin utilises three action hooks:

* [add_meta_boxes](http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/hook/add_meta_boxes) is used to remove the excerpt meta box generated by Wordpress
* [edit_form_advanced](http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/hook/edit_form_advanced) is used to add the excerpt editor to posts.
* [edit_page_form](http://adambrown.info/p/wp_hooks/hook/edit_page_form) is used to add the excerpt editor to pages.

**Note:** the new editing box cannot be placed in a sortable, movable meta box because of an issue with using TinyMCE in sortables documented here:

http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19173

The editing box for excerpts uses [wp_editor](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_editor) to create a rich text editor. You can set the options for the rich text editor in the plugin options page (in the Wordpress  Settings menu).

The plugin also contains two filters which act on the "teeny" MCE editor instance which is used by default. The plugins and buttons used by the minimal editor can also be customised on the plugin options page. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin using the Plugin options page under the Settings menu

If you want to use excerpts in pages, add this to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`add_post_type_support('pages', 'excerpt');`

See [add_post_type_support](add_post_type_support) in the Codex for details.

If you want to use excerpts in Custom Post Types, do it when you create them using the `supports` array in the arguments for [register_post_type](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type).

== Contribute ==

At the moment, the plugin uses [html_entity_decode](http://php.net/manual/en/function.html-entity-decode.php) to decode encoded entities in the excerpt content prior to displaying it in the editor. It would be nice to find a more robust way of accessing the excerpt field data using a Wordpress filter.

If you can translate this plugin, please get in touch - there is a POT file with the plugin for translators to use.
